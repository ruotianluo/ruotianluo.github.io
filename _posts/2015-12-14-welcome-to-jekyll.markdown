Here is the new blog. I really hope I can manage it quite well.
This blog is in Jekyll, em.... Yeah, Still working on it.

Borrow many instruction form this [blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). Here about google analytics, I set up a new tracking id for my blog which is not that consistent. There are something called cross domain tracking which can aggregate the user information of both sites (and can recoginize the same user entering both site, which is not true for two tracking ids). Here is [one](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1034342?hl=en), which seems to add a invisible link between two sites. Another is [this](https://www.optimizesmart.com/cross-domain-tracking-in-universal-analytics-demystified/). This actually covers both.

Update: I'm now using the allowlinker methods. But I still use two different tracking id. I'll see how this works.
