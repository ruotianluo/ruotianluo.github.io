Two days ago, Kaiming He make their [ResNet](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks) public, and includes the various pretrained model. I was excited and download the model immediately and try to use loadcaffe module to use the ResNet. Sadly, the loadcaffe seems not to support the Batch Normalizations.

Okay, however, this morning, I found facebook has released their ResNet ([fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch)) model which has maximum 101 layers but has a better result on validation error. I think facebook just released it yesterday, so it's pretty fresh now. The facebook version is also now on the page of Kaiming's Resnet page, and also with some other versions.

So, a immediate idea to me is to use the ResNet on neuraltalk2, because it's really easy to plug in the original framework. Facebook has a clear code how to extract feature from an image.

The code is here. In principle, it's just remove the VGG and put ResNet in (less than 100-line modification). The link is here [neuraltalk2_resnet](https://github.com/ruotianluo/neuraltalk2_resnet). I am still training it, so there may be some bugs.

Enjoy and please point out the bugs.
