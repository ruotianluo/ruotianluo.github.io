Although it is sad that DeepMind moves to Tensorflow, it is not surprising at all. Google team uses Google stuff. However, it is not likely that facebook will move to tensorflow too, so there is nothing more to worry about. And also a bunch of companies and scholar are still stick to Torch.

There has appeared a bunch of new projects based on Torch in recent months. I believe Torch is gathering more and more favor.

I have also updated my [awesome torch](https://github.com/ruotianluo/awesome-torch), here is what I added.
